Ever since I read about the Ionic Framework, I always wanted to try it out. Building an App with pure React Components? I'm in.
And since all the heavy lifting was already done, converting my "Make Me Awesome" Wepapp was a breeze.
Still, this is only an MVP since I didn't spend much time styling the Components, so bear with me if some things don't look as polished as they could.
Also, since this was just for educational purposes, there is no "real" App in the IOS/Play Store.
